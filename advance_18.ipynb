    "Text files and binary files differ in their data representation and readability. Text files store data as plain text, making them human-readable and editable using basic text editors. They are commonly used for documents and code. In contrast, binary files store data in a compact binary format, which is not easily readable or editable by humans. Binary files are used for storing non-textual data like images, audio, or executable programs. While text files are easily understood, binary files are more efficient in terms of storage but require specialized software to interpret and modify their contents."
