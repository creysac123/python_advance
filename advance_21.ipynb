    "A probability distribution is a mathematical function that describes the likelihood of different outcomes or events. While individual values from a probability distribution are random and unpredictable, the distribution provides information about the overall pattern of the random variable. By analyzing the distribution, we can make predictions about the likelihood of specific outcomes or estimate statistical properties. Probability distributions help us understand and quantify uncertainty in various fields."

Pseudo-random numbers are considered \"good enough\" because they exhibit properties of randomness and pass statistical tests, making them suitable for many practical applications."
